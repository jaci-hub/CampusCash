# CampusCash

Quick overview: 
  Campus Cash is like DoorDash + Venmo (or a combination of similar platforms) for colleges and universities.

Goal:
  My goal is very simple: to make sure students in all colleges and universities feel more entitled and independent about their "campus cash/food"; I want to provide students more control over their "campus cash", which includes:
    - enabling students to order food (living ON or OFF campus) from the campus cafeteria or any other building that provides food for students - I see a real potential here for more work-study jobs!!!
    - enabling students to send each other campus cash.
    - enabling students to send each other campus meals.

Purpose:
  The purpose is to allow students to help each other when in need, as well as making things easier when it comes to getting food on campus. 
  For example, if a student runs out of meals during the week and is low on cash, then the student can have a friend send them some cash and just get food from another food building, so the student donâ€™t have to wait until the meals renew again in the weekend to be able to eat. Another example is if the cafe is closed and a student is low in cash, then the student can ask a friend to send some cash so they can eat in another food building instead. Also, Campus Cash will be really beneficial to students who cant physically get the food themselves from the food building either because they are sick and/or in quarantine, so they can just order their food, without needing to worry about asking someone to get them food.
  In addition, students DO NOT have a way to check/track how much cash they have left until they go to a certain food building and ask a worker to check it for them, which is usually done by printing it on a paper (and then we have the whole global warming argument coming in:)). So, this project also aims to solve that problem. On top of that, to avoid printing receipts in paper(which no one uses anyway, resulting in more paper being wasted again), the receipt or transaction record can be directly sent/reflected on the platform instead.
